        <h1>K-9 Karate</h1>
        <p>Here at Dio-G Dojo not only are we the pioneers of canine karate, we're also the <em>only</em>
            dojo that specializes in this art form, and so subsequently, we are the #1 dog karate Dojo
            anywhere in the world. Literally anywhere. Pick a place. We're it. #1. And that feels good.
        </p>
        <p>So you're probaby asking yourself,"what do you do at Dio-G Dojo? Teach my dog
            the ancient art of karate? To my dog?" Yea, dummy, we do. Answered your on question.
        </p>
        <p>But of course, our methods aren't conventional, mainly because we invented the methods,
            but just to give you a taste of what you can expect from us at Dio-G, we put your dog 
            through a series of strenuous tests that build patience, confidence and above all a higher
            sense of purpose. For example, we force the dogs to paint our fence, sand the floors,
            wash and wax our plethora of automobiles, and sometimes, but not always, run our errands
            for us. And if you're asking yourself "how does that teach my dog karate, you're just making him OR HER
            do your chores for you?" Well you're an idiot and I have 6 cars. But don't take my word for it,
            just listen to what our satisfied customers had to say. Next page, you gotta go to the next page
            to see what they said, you're reading, this isn't a video. Next one over, yep, there you go, 
            you got.
